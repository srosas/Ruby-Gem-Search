A search application that takes a user's search query, hits the [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/) search API endpoint, and displays the results in a list view. Built with React, and Router.

## Getting started

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Instructions

```
Search for any ruby gems and save the ones you want. The app stores your saved gems in Local Storage so they will still remain even after you have refreshed the page by going to 'Saved Gems'
```
